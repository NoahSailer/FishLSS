This folder contains configuration files for various DESI-II surveys, as well as config files for similar surveys (e.g. Euclid's Halpha sample). `setup.py` can be used to compute various derivatives on a compute node, and can be modified to compute your derivatives of choice. The setup script (and config files) needs to be moved to the FishLSS directory to run, someday I'll get around to removing hard coded paths...
