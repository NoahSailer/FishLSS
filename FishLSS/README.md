**Code structure**

```experiment.py``` is used to define the experiment object (redshift range, sky coverage, linear bias, number density, etc.). ```twoPoint.py``` contains all the code relevant for computing power spectra, while ```twoPointNoise.py``` contains all the code relevant for computing covariance matrices. ```fisherForecast.py``` is used to define a forecast object, compute derivatives and Fisher matrices. ```castorina.py``` contains the assumed evolution of the 21cm linear bias. CMB fisher matrices, CMB lensing noise curves, and the assumed fiducial reionization history can be found in ```input/```. The directory ```bao_recon/```, which is a copy of [ZeldovichReconPk](https://github.com/sfschen/ZeldovichReconPk), is used to compute the reconstructed power spectrum, and is wrapped in ```twoPoint.py```.
